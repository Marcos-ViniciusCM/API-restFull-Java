Inventory Management API using Java Servlets

Welcome to the repository of a Java Servlets-based API for inventory management. This project aims to provide a straightforward solution for handling inventory operations via a RESTful interface using Java Servlets, without the need for additional frameworks.

Key Features:
RESTful Endpoints: Implements CRUD operations for managing inventory items and transactions.

Basic Security: Includes basic authentication and authorization principles to secure sensitive endpoints.

Data Validation: Implements input validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.

Technologies Used:
Java Servlets: Used to define and manage API endpoints and associated business logic.

JSON: Data format used for exchanging information between the client and server.

Repository Structure:
src/main/java: Contains Java Servlets defining API endpoints and business logic.

WebContent/WEB-INF: Directory containing the web.xml configuration file specifying Servlet settings.

Getting Started:
To use this API, deploy it on a Java EE-compliant web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat). Once deployed, access the defined endpoints to perform CRUD operations related to inventory management.

This project is ideal for developers looking to understand how to build RESTful APIs using Java Servlets, exploring foundational concepts of web architecture and API development best practices.
